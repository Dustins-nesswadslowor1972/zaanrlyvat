Just walked out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Riff Raff and I’m kinda all over the place right now. Doesn’t help that I’m lacking a little sleep. But hey, what a ride. Was this supposed to be a comedy? A tragedy? A comedy turned tragedy? I can’t even tell. It’s like the director took a blender, threw in some working-class grit and existential dread, and just hit pulse until it all turned into this bizarre smoothie of chaos.

The characters, oh man, they feel like people you’d meet at that dodgy pub down the street where the beer's flat and conversations are flatter. Is that a compliment? I dunno. Sometimes, I felt like they’re talking at me, not to me, like I’m the guy they met once who owes them money. You ever sit in a room full of people and suddenly realize you're the only one who feels sane? Or maybe you’re the insane one… yeah, that’s what this   does.

And I swear if I have to hear one more person butcher the Scottish accent, I’ll… I dunno, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and dub it myself? Kidding. I loved it and hated it, kinda like an ex you still text when you’ve had one too many drinks. The scenes shot through this weird gray filter, probably to hide the budget, gave me a headache but also this funky feeling like I was diving into an oil painting—ugly and beautiful at once. And I'm all tangled in its strokes whether I like it or not.

> At one point, there’s this scene—it’s construction, right? And the guy snaps back at his boss with something so sharp it could cut steel. It’s raw, that kind of unpolished raw that makes you cringe and laugh at the same time. Like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a car crash but realizing too late it’s your car.

Here comes the part where I’m supposed to say if you gotta see it or skip it. How should I know? It’s like trying to recommend Marmite. Love it or hate it, but damn if you aren’t the better for giving it a go. Maybe 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   first, just don’t say I didn’t warn you.

if (mood === frustrated && popcorn === empty) { 
    console.log(Time for dinner.);
}

So yeah, Riff Raff. It’s like that memorable meal you never forget because it wasn’t just food. It was an experience. Maybe not your cup of tea, or pint of ale, or whatever else—but hey, it’s a story you’ll tell or a 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 you'll trash. Who said 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘴 have to be tidy anyway? Not this one, at least.
